            <h2 id="services">Our Services</h2>
            <p>Medi-Comm is a web-based service that allows clinics to communicate with their patients. Thousands of clinics have enlisted our help to establish a virtual presence. We have set up clinics with their clients by showcasing their online profile and connecting them through virtual doctors of the clinic's choosing. Patients will be able to visit tens of thousands of clinics across the United States by using our platform. After selecting a clinic patients can use our platform to book appointments with that specific clinic. Medi-Comm aspires to facilitate the formation of a relationship between patients and their doctors comfortably and simply.</p>
            <h2 id="why">Why Us?</h2>
            <p>Many clinics all over the country use our platform. The smooth connection of virtual appointments has been appreciated by both providers and patients. Patients in the United States can choose from a wide range of clinics that normally would not be possible, while providers will be able to attract a larger number of customers and will no longer be restricted to their local market. This is made possible by Medi-Comm's ability to make virtual appointments a pleasant and satisfying experience for both providers and their patients.</p>
